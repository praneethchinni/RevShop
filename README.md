RevShop 
The RevShop project aims to develop a secure, user-friendly, and versatile e-commerce application for both buyers and sellers. The core functionalities for buyers include browsing products, adding products to a cart, checkout, and payment 
processing. Sellers can add products, manage inventory, and fulfill orders. The project's completion will be demonstrated through a cloud-hosted working version, technical presentation, and associated diagrams.
